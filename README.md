# Welcome :wave:

Hey I'm Andrew. If you've stumbled here it means I wanted you to see my portfolio. Included are some small projects I've worked in the past mostly for school but some for small passion projects. I'm currently working on building up my Git/Digital Portfolio as many of my works were on websites/Shopify stores while at work, so I hope you can appreciate and enjoy looking at what I could include.

<em> I love learning and the more I learn the less I feel like I know anything at all. If you have a need for something to get done with a specific skill, language or program in mind that I don't know, I'll tell you and then I'll figure out a way to get it done. </em>
