# Welcome

Hey I'm Andrew. If you've stumbled here it means I wanted you to see my portfolio. Included are some small projects I've worked in the past mostly for school but some for small passion projects. I'm currently working on building up my Git & digital Portfolio as many of my works were on websites/Shopify stores so I hope you can appreciate and enjoy what I could include.



## Websites
Here's a list of a few websites I've worked on.
- Marketing & Design [Heraime](https://www.heirame.com/) (2020)
- UI, UX & Content from [Aaron Kates Financial](http://www.aaronkatesfinancial.com/) to [Mortage Wizard](https://mortgagewizard.ca/) (2020)

## Fun Facts

I'm half Chinese and half Romanian (I'm fluent in understanding both languages but I can't speak them very well)
I used to play competitive counter strike (here's my steam https://steamcommunity.com/id/spartinii/)
I was in boy Scouts for 10 years, I love the outdoors
