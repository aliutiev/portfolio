# Welcome :wave:

Hey I'm Andrew. Included are some small projects I've worked on mostly for school but also for small passion projects. I'm working on building up my Git/Digital Portfolio as many of my works were on websites/Shopify stores so I couldn't include everything but I hope you can appreciate and enjoy looking at what I could.

I love learning and the more I learn the less I feel like I know anything at all. If you have a need for something to get done with a specific skill, language or program in mind that I don't know, <em> I'll tell you and then I'll figure out a way to get it done. </em>
